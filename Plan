Voidwind

Ship

Items
Armour
Systems
Crew

Crew -> Healthy/Wounded

Weapons -> Armour/Internal/Crew effectiveness

Boarding -> Destroy less cargo?

Maybe no ports? Just trade with existing ships? Simplify a bit. Capture ships?

Ports needed for economy? I guess not necessarily. Forts!

Combine bulk with items screens.

Unified buy/sell/rearrange screen, based on slots!

On main screen, control groups for weapons?


For Wind, use A* I guess? Does A* work for asymmetrical costs? Maybe?



Extra stuff:

Water trails somehow?

Day/Night cycle + sun shadows?

Wind indicators somehow?

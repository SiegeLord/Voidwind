Wednesday

    - Item destruction.
    
    Control groups (on inventory screen, shown on both screens)
    
    Economy.

    Done:
        - Experience
        - A different method for weapon recovery, based on which weapons need recovering to encourage control groups
        - Crew recruitment
        - Boarding (for player)
        - Select target
        - Ship systems (see below, still current mostly)
        - Priority selection (on main screen, show a symbol when focused, a star?)
        - Don't switch with dead vessels

Voidwind

Ship

Items
Armour
Systems
Crew

Crew -> Healthy/Wounded

Weapons -> Armour/Internal/Crew effectiveness

Boarding -> Destroy less cargo? Kill crew selectively.

Maybe no ports? Just trade with existing ships? Simplify a bit. Capture ships?

Ports needed for economy? I guess not necessarily. Forts!

Combine bulk with items screens.

Unified buy/sell/rearrange screen, based on slots!

On main screen, control groups for weapons?


For Wind, use A* I guess? Does A* work for asymmetrical costs? Maybe?



Extra stuff:

Water trails somehow?

Day/Night cycle + sun shadows?

Wind indicators somehow?
